Utility for extracting statistics from WebKit ChangeLogs.

To use, build ccchanges and run it thusly:
./ccchanges < /path/to/ChangeLog

By default it prints out a count of commits and reviews for every change found in the ChangeLog. These counts can be restricted in various ways, see --help for details.

I didn't know go at all when starting on this project and still don't, so there's quite a bit of ugliness.
